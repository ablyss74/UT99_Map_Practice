### Maps I've made for UT99 "Unreal Tournament 99"
1. Entanglment - Really requires a jet mutator for flying.  A hidden pasage leads to the opposite teams base.
2. Two_Pyramids_at_Night - My first large map with a skydrop. Version 2 fixes some lighting issues, and other stuff.
3. !Warped - Unfinished map. Has a warping teleportal effect.
